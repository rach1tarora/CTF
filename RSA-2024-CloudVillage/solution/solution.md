### 2. Confirm Existing Files in the Blob

Use the following curl command to confirm all files that exist or have existed in the blob:

```bash
curl -H "x-ms-version: 2020-10-02" 'https://botsilver.blob.core.windows.net/$web?restype=container&comp=list'
```

### 3. Get the Version IDs for the Files

List and manage file versions with curl commands as needed.

### 4. Download the `backup.zip` File

Download the specific file using a similar curl command specifying the version ID:

```bash
curl -H "x-ms-version: 2020-10-02" 'https://botsilver.blob.core.windows.net/$web/backup.zip?versionId=<version-id>'
```

### 5. Expand the Zipped Backup File

Unzip the downloaded `backup.zip` and examine its contents:

```bash
